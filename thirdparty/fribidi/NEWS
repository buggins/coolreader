Overview of changes between 0.19.7 and 1.0
=============================================

* Full isolate and parenthesis support as per Unicode 6.3 to Unicode 10.0 .

  compatible. Calling the older function will use default values for
  the new bracket properties and will sometimes yield non-compliant
  results.
